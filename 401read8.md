## List Comprehensions in Python

List comprehensions provide a concise way to create lists.

It consists of brackets containing an expression followed by a for clause, then zero or more for or if clauses. The expressions can be anything, meaning you can put in all kinds of objects in lists.

The result will be a new list resulting from evaluating the expression in the context of the for and if clauses which follow it.

The list comprehension always returns a result list.

If you used to do it like this:

`new_list = []`

`for i in old_list:`

`if filter(i):`
    
`new_list.append(expressions(i))`

You can obtain the same thing using list comprehension. Notice the append method has vanished!

`new_list = [expression(i) for i in old_list if filter(i)]`

### Create a simple list

Let’s start easy by creating a simple list.

`x = [i for i in range(10)]`

`print x`

This will give the output:

[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]

That’s how you can create a simple list.

Create a list using loops and list comprehension
For the next example, assume we want to create a list of squares. Start with an empty list.

### You can either use loops:

squares = []

for x in range(10):

    squares.append(x**2)
 
print squares

[0, 1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81]

### Or you can use list comprehensions to get the same result:

squares = [x**2 for x in range(10)]

print squares

[0, 1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81]

Just remember the syntax: [ expression for item in list if conditional ]

### Multiplying parts of a list

Multiply every part of a list by three and assign it to a new list.

list1 = [3,4,5]
 
multiplied = [item*3 for item in list1] 
 
print multiplied 

[9,12,15]

Note how the item*3 multiplies each piece by 3.
