## Next.js: The React Framework

Enter Next.js, the React Framework. Next.js provides a solution to all this problems:

* Code has to be bundled using a bundler like webpack and transformed using a compiler like Babel.

* You need to do production optimizations such as code splitting.

* You might want to statically pre-render some pages for performance and SEO. You might also want to use server-side rendering or client-side rendering.

* You might have to write some server-side code to connect your React app to your data store.
But more importantly, it puts you and your team in the pit of success when building React applications.

### Create a Next.js app

To create a Next.js app, open your terminal, cd into the directory you’d like to create the app in, and run the following command:
```
npx create-next-app nextjs-blog --use-npm --example "https://github.com/vercel/next-learn-starter/tree/master/learn-starter"
```

If you see an installation error try run this:

```
npm init next-app nextjs-blog
```

### Assets

Next.js can serve static assets, like images, under the top-level public directory. Files inside public can be referenced from the root of the application similar to pages.

* Image Component : next/image is an extension of the HTML `<img>` element, evolved for the modern web.

Next.js also has support for Image Optimization by default. This allows for resizing, optimizing, and serving images in modern formats. This avoids shipping large images to devices with a smaller viewport. Automatic Image Optimization works with any image source. Even if the image is hosted by an external data source, like a CMS, it can still be optimized.

Instead of optimizing images at build time, Next.js optimizes images on-demand, as users request them. Unlike static site generators and static-only solutions, your build times aren’t increased, whether shipping 10 images or 10 million images.

Images are lazy loaded by default. That means your page speed isn’t penalized for images outside the viewport. Images load as they are scrolled into viewport.

Example:
```
import Image from 'next/image'

const YourComponent = () => (
  <Image
    src="/images/profile.jpg" // Route of the image file
    height={144} // Desired size with correct aspect ratio
    width={144} // Desired size with correct aspect ratio
    alt="Your Name"
  />
)
```

### Metadata

`<Head>` is used instead of the lowercase `<head>`. `<Head>` is a React Component that is built into Next.js. It allows you to modify the `<head>` of a page.
`<Head>`
 ` <title>Create Next App</title>`
`  <link rel="icon" href="/favicon.ico" />`
`</Head>`

You can import the Head component from the next/head module.

### CSS Styling

If you take a look at pages/index.js, you should see code like this:
```
<style jsx>{`
  …
`}</style>
```

This page is using a library called styled-jsx. It’s a “CSS-in-JS” library — it lets you write CSS within a React component, and the CSS styles will be scoped (other components won’t be affected).

Next.js has built-in support for CSS and Sass which allows you to import .css and .scss files.

Using popular CSS libraries like Tailwind CSS is also supported.

CSS Modules automatically generates unique class names. As long as you use CSS Modules, you don’t have to worry about class name collisions.
