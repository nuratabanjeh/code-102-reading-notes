## COMPARING OPERATORS:
## EVALUATING CONDITIONS
There is some ways to compare values and the data type:

•	== equal to it compares tow values to check if they are the same, for example: ‘hello’ == ‘goodbye’ will give you false cuz the are not the same but if ‘hello == ‘hello’ will be true

•	!= is not equal to, this will compare two values if they are not the same for example: 
‘hello’ != ‘ goodbye’ will give you true because yes they are not the same

•	=== strict equal to, it compares both of the datatype and the value for example: 
‘3’ === ‘3’ will give you false because they are not the same datatype 

•	!== strict not equal to, it compares both of the datatype and the value to check that they are not equal for example: ‘3’ !== 3 will give you a true because yes they are not the same.

•	> it will check if the value on the left greater than the one on right for example: 3 > 2 will give you true

•	< it will check if the value on the left smaller than the one on the right for example: 2 < 3 will give you true.

•	>= it will check if the value on the left greater than or equal the one on right for example: 3 >= 3 will give you true

•	<= it will check if the value on the left smaller than or equal the one on the right for example:     3 <= 4  will give you true.

LOGICAL OPERATIONS

•	Logical operations which are (&&,||,!) will compare the results of more than one comparison operator 
((5<2) && ( 3>=2))
Both sides are false so the result will be false

•	EXAMPLES:
-	&& (logical and) for more than one condition
((2<5) &&(3>=2)) will give you true
-	`||` (logical or) for just one condition
((2<5) `||` (2<1)) will give true
-	! (logical not) it gives the opposite of answer
!(2<1) will give true.
LOOPS
loops are used to make a set of instructions repeatedly when some conditions become true.
Loops are 3 common types:
1.	For (when you need to run a code a specific times)
2.	While ( when you don’t now how many times you will run the code)
3.	Do while (its very similar to the while loop) 
•	Loop structure
Key word (condition) {code}
•	The for loop has 3 phases
-	Initialization
-	Condition
-	Update
Example:
For i=0; i<10; i++{the code}
