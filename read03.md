* how to make process and design : we need to decide who is the site for (target) and what they needs then, do a site map for the hyperlinks, then we will design by making a skitch called wireframe, in wire frame deside also what colors and styling and size that you want
* there was a common HTML elements before but now there is a new HTML5 element, they more helpful.
* there is extra Markup for HTML, grouping text and elemnt inline like  < spam > and < iframe > and < meta >
* You can use grouping and similarity to help simplify 
the information you present.
* Older browsers that do not understand HTML5 
elements need to be told which elements are 
block-level elements.
