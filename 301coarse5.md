## React Docs - thinking in React

1. How would you break a mock into a component heirarchy?

* draw boxes around every component (and subcomponent) in the mock and give them all names. 

2. What is the single responsibility principle and how does it apply to components?

* a component should ideally only do one thing. If it ends up growing, it should be decomposed into smaller subcomponents.

3. What does it mean to build a ‘static’ version of your application?

* The components will only have render() and no interactivity.

4. Once you have a static application, what do you need to add?

* add State to make the UI interactive

5. What are the three questions you can ask to determine if something is state?

* Is it passed in from a parent via props? If so, it probably isn’t state.

* Does it remain unchanged over time? If so, it probably isn’t state.

* Can you compute it based on any other state or props in your component? If so, it isn’t state.

6. How can you identify where state needs to live?

* Identify every component that renders something based on that state.

* Find a common owner component (a single component above all the components that need the state in the hierarchy).

* Either the common owner or another component higher up in the hierarchy should own the state.

* If you can’t find a component where it makes sense to own the state, create a new component solely for holding the state and add it somewhere in the hierarchy above the common owner component.
