## Mongo and Mongoose

## nosql vs sql

1. Fill in the chart below with five differences between SQL and NoSQL databases:

| SQL                                                                           | NoSQL                                             |
| ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| called as Relational Databases (RDBMS)                                        | called as non-relational or distributed database. |
| table based databases                                                         | document based                                    |
| predefined schema                                                             | dynamic schema for unstructured data.             |
| vertically scalable                                                           | horizontally scalable                             |
| uses SQL ( structured query language ) for defining and manipulating the data | focused on collection of documents.               |

1. What kind of data is a good fit for an SQL database?

- data that is highly structured

2. Give a real world example.

- SQL database examples: MySql, Oracle, Sqlite, Postgres and MS-SQL.

3. What kind of data is a good fit a NoSQL database?

-NoSQL database fits better for the hierarchical data storage as it follows the key-value pair way of storing data similar to JSON data. NoSQL database are highly preferred for large data set (i.e for big data). Hbase is an example for this purpose.

4. Give a real world example.

- NoSQL database examples: MongoDB, BigTable, Redis, RavenDb, Cassandra, Hbase, Neo4j and CouchDb

5. Which type of database is best for hierarchical data storage?

- NoSQL

6. Which type of database is best for scalability?

- NoSQL databases

### nosql vs sql

1. What does SQL stand for?

- Structured Query Language

2. What is a relational database?

- relational database is a type of database that stores and provides access to data points that are related to one another.

3. What type of structure does a relational database work with?

- logical data structures

4. What is a ‘schema’?

- is an abstract design that represents the storage of your data in a database. It describes both the organization of data and the relationships between tables in a given database.

5. What is a NoSQL database?

- databases that store data in a format other than relational tables.

7. What is inside of a Mongo database?

- documents

- collections

8. Which is more flexible - SQL or MongoDB? and why.

- MongoDB; because you don't have to use a Schema

9. What is the disadvantage of a NoSQL database?

- you will have some duplicate data and if other data in a collection changes you need to update the other collection
