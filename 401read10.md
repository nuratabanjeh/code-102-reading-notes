# Stacks 

the stack is a data structure that consists of (Nodes)

### the most used terminology for a stack:

 1. push (adding)

2. pop (delete)

3. top (declaring the top)

4. peek (to see the value of the top node)

5. isEmpty (true when stack is empty)

### FILO & LIFO:

FILO means that the first added into the stack is the last out and LIFO is the opposite of FILO

#### Pushing a Node onto a stack will always be an O(1) operation. This is because it takes the same amount of time no matter how many Nodes (n) you have in the stack.

## Main steps of Push:

1. prepare the node you want to add 

2. assign the next property

3. re assign the top node

## Main steps of Pop:

1. create a reference that points to the same point that top points to

2. re assign the top

3. make sure that you clear out the next property in your current temp reference.

4. return the value of the temp Node that was just popped off.

# Queue:

Like stack, queue is a linear data structure that stores items in **FIFO & LILO** the first in first out and lilo is the opposite.

A good example of queue is any queue of consumers for a resource where the consumer that came first is served first.

### the most used terminology for a Queue:

1. Enqueue (add)

2. Dequeue (remove)

3. Front (first node)

4. Rear (last node)

5. Peek (view the value of the front node)

6. isEmpty (true when queue is empty)

#### When you add an item to a queue, you use the enqueue action. This is done with an O(1) operation in time because it does not matter how many other items live in the queue (n); it takes the same amount of time to perform the operation.
