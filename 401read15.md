## Trees 

In this tutorial, we’ll be covering Binary Trees, Binary Search Trees, and K-ary Trees. We will review some common terminology that is shared amongst all of the trees and then dive into specifics of the different types.

### Common Terminology

* Node - A Tree node is a component which may contain it’s own values, and references to other nodes

* Root - The root is the node at the beginning of the tree

* K - A number that specifies the maximum number of children any node may have in a k-ary tree. In a binary tree, k = 2.

* Left - A reference to one child node, in a binary tree

* Right - A reference to the other child node, in a binary tree

* Edge - The edge in a tree is the link between a parent and child node

* Leaf - A leaf is a node that does not have any children

* Height - The height of a tree is the number of edges from the root to the furthest leaf

### Traversals:

An important aspect of trees is how to traverse them. Traversing a tree allows us to search for a node, print out the contents of a tree, and much more! There are two categories of traversals when it comes to trees:

* Depth First

* Breadth First

### Binary Tree Vs K-ary Trees

In all of our examples, we’ve been using a Binary Tree. Trees can have any number of children per node, but Binary Trees restrict the number of children to two (hence our left and right children).

There is no specific sorting order for a binary tree. Nodes can be added into a binary tree wherever space allows. Here is what a binary tree looks like:
