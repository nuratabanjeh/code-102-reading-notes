## HTML Headings

We use headings in HTML to highlight important topics. there are six levels of headings classified based on the importance of the topic.

Example:

`<h1>` Heading `</h1>`

## HTML Paragraphs

When ever you want to write a text below a heading for example you will use the paragraph tag:

`<p>` paragraph `</p>`

**If you want to style the text (bold,italic,etc):**

## `<br />` and `<hr />` tags 

Those two tags are only opening tags, If you want to start a new line throughout the paragraph type `<br />`

Also, if you want to make a line break (horizontal line) type `<hr />`

## what is CSS??

Cascading Style Sheets is a style sheet language used for describing the presentation of a document written in a markup language like HTML.

## How CSS works?

CSS will style your pages by interacting with HTML elements. Elements are the individual HTML components of a web page—for instance a paragraph—which in HTML might look like this:

< p >This is my paragraph! < /p > If you wanted to make this paragraph appear pink and bold to people viewing your web page through a web browser, you’d use CSS code that looks like this:

p { color:pink; font-weight:bold; } In this case, “p” (the paragraph) is called the “selector”—it’s the part of CSS code specifying which HTML element the CSS styling will effect. In CSS, the selector is written to the left of the first curly bracket. The information between curly brackets is called a declaration, and it contains properties and values that are applied to the selector. Properties are things like font size, color, and margins, while values are the settings for those properties. In the example above, “color” and “font-weight” are both properties, and “pink” and “bold” are values. The full bracketed set of { color:pink; font-weight:bold; } is the declaration, and again, “p” (meaning the HTML paragraph) is the selector. These same basic principles can be applied to change font sizes, background colors, margin indentations, and more. For instance. body { background-color:lightblue; } .would make your page’s background light blue, or. p { font-size:20px; color:red; } .will create a 20 point font paragraph with red letters.

## How to apply or connect your CSS code with your HTML code?
1.	Internal method:

You will type the css code inside the `<script></script>` tag locally in the HTML code
2.	External method:

You will create a css file that will hold your css code, to apply this code on your HTML code you will link them be `<script src=””></script>`
3.	Inline CSS : An inline style may be used to apply a unique style for a single element. 

To make our web-site interact with the user we should use JavaScript.

## What is JavaScript?

JavaScript is high-level, often just-in-time compiled, and multi-paradigm. It has curly-bracket syntax, dynamic typing, prototype-based object-orientation, and first-class functions. So, JavaScrips is a group of statements that gives instructions and here is some of those statements :

•	JavaScript Comments : JavaScript comments can be used to explain JavaScript code, and to make it more readable. JavaScript comments can also be used to prevent execution, when testing alternative code.

•	JavaScript Variables : JavaScript variables are containers for storing data values.

•	JavaScript Arrays : JavaScript arrays are used to store multiple values in a single variable.

•	JavaScript Expressions : An expression is any valid unit of code that resolves to a value.

•	JavaScript Operators : JavaScript operators are used to assign values, compare values,perform arithmetic operations, and more.

•	JavaScript Strings : JavaScript strings are used for storing and manipulating text.

## Decisions and Loops :

To make decisions we should use conditional statements that included in the JavaScript code assist with decision making, based on certain conditions. The condition specified in the conditional statement can either be true or false. The conditional statements execute the associated piece of code only if the condition is true.

In JavaScript we have the following conditional statements:

1.	Use if to specify a block of code to be executed, if a specified condition is true.

2.	Use else to specify a block of code to be executed, if the same condition is false.

3.	Use else if to specify a new condition to test, if the first condition is false.

4.	Use switch to specify many alternative blocks of code to be executed.

**Comparison operators are used in logical statements to determine equality or difference between variables or values.**
