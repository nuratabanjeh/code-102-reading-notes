# React

React (also known as React.js or ReactJS) is a JavaScript library that aims to simplify development of visual interfaces.

## React Features :

1. JSX − JSX is JavaScript syntax extension. It isn’t necessary to use JSX in React development, but it is recommended.

2. Components − React is all about components. You need to think of everything as a component. This will help you maintain the code when working on larger scale projects.

3. Unidirectional data flow and Flux − React implements one-way data flow which makes it easy to reason about your app. Flux is a pattern that helps keeping your data unidirectional.

4. License

## React Advantages:

* Uses virtual DOM which is a JavaScript object. This will improve apps performance, since JavaScript virtual DOM is faster than the regular DOM.

* Can be used on client and server side as well as with other frameworks.

* Component and data patterns improve readability, which helps to maintain larger apps.

## Introducing JSX

It is called JSX, and it is a syntax extension to JavaScript. We recommend using it with React to describe what the UI should look like. JSX may remind you of a template language, but it comes with the full power of JavaScript.


## Embedding Expressions in JSX 

In the example below, we declare a variable called name and then use it inside JSX by wrapping it in curly braces:

    const name = 'Josh Perez';const element = <h1>Hello, {name}</h1>;
    ReactDOM.render(
    element,
    document.getElementById('root')
    );

## Rendering Elements

An element describes what you want to see on the screen:

    const element = <h1>Hello, world</h1>;
    
## Rendering an Element into the DOM 

Let's say there is a <div> somewhere in your HTML file:

    <div id="root"></div>


## Updating the Rendered Element 

React elements are immutable. Once you create an element, you can't change its children or attributes. An element is like a single frame in a movie: it represents the UI at a certain point in time.

Consider this ticking clock example:



    function tick() {
    const element = (
        <div>
        <h1>Hello, world!</h1>
        <h2>It is {new Date().toLocaleTimeString()}.</h2>
        </div>
    );
    ReactDOM.render(element, document.getElementById('root'));}

    setInterval(tick, 1000);

## React Only Updates What's Necessary 

React DOM compares the element and its children to the previous one, and only applies the DOM updates necessary to bring the DOM to the desired state.
