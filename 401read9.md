## Enriching Your Python Classes With Dunder (Magic, Special) Methods

#### What Are Dunder Methods?

In Python, special methods are a set of predefined methods you can use to enrich your classes. They are easy to recognize because they start and end with double underscores, for example init or str.

As it quickly became tiresome to say under-under-method-under-under Pythonistas adopted the term “dunder methods”, a short form of “double under.”

These “dunders” or “special methods” in Python are also sometimes called “magic methods.” But using this terminology can make them seem more complicated than they really are—at the end of the day there’s nothing “magical” about them. You should treat these methods like a normal language feature.

Dunder methods let you emulate the behavior of built-in types. For example, to get the length of a string you can call len('string'). But an empty class definition doesn’t support this behavior out of the box:

``` 
class NoLenSupport:
    pass

>>> obj = NoLenSupport()
>>> len(obj)

TypeError: "object of type 'NoLenSupport' has no len()"
```
To fix this, you can add a len dunder method to your class:

```
class LenSupport:
    def __len__(self):
        return 42

>>> obj = LenSupport()
>>> len(obj)
42
```
Another example is slicing. You can implement a getitem method which allows you to use Python’s list slicing syntax: obj`[start:stop]`.

## Basic Statistics in Python — Probability

#### What is probability?

At the most basic level, probability seeks to answer the question, “What is the chance of an event happening?” An event is some outcome of interest. To calculate the chance of an event happening, we also need to consider all the other events that can occur. The quintessential representation of probability is the humble coin toss. In a coin toss the only events that can happen are:

* Flipping a heads

* Flipping a tails
