# whiteboards and interviews

1. Restate the Question

Restate the Question they asked to make sure that you fully understand the question.

#### 1.1 Write down the steps of the solution

Write down the general steps before going into code of how you woul solve the problem.

1. Start at middle of array.
2. Keep variables tracking left and right boundaries of search area.
3. If value equal to search_val, return true.
4. If left and right boundaries are adjacent, return false.
5. If value bigger than search_val, go halfway towards left boundary, and move the right boundary along with us.
6. If value smaller than search_val, go halfway towards right boundary, and move the left boundary along with us.

#### 2. Ask About Edge Cases

Think about the about the input and expect the out put and ask them about it.

#### 3. Ask About Test Cases

This is a FREE question so you want to take advantage of it.

#### 4. Write Pseudocode

Before you go to code, write the pseudocode first and aske the interviewer if it mamke sense, in the worst case they will not give you any feed back.
```
function fizzBuzz(n) {
 // If n is not a number or not an integer greater
 // than zero, return null

 // create empty array to store output

 // Loop through numbers from 1 to n

  // If number modulo 3 is zero, add ‘fizz’
  // to output array
  // Else If number modulo 5 is zero,
  // add ‘buzz’ to output array
  // Else If number modulo 3 is zero and
  // number modulo 5 is zero, add ‘fizzbuzz’
  // to array
  // Else add the number to the array

 // return output array
}
```

#### 5. Write the Actual Code

Now its time to convert your pseudocode into an actual code, they might offer some help.
```
function fizzBuzz(n) {
 if (isNaN(n) || !Number.isInteger(n) || n < 1) return null;
 let output = [];
 for (let i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
  if (i % 3 === 0 && i % 5 === 0) {
   output.push(“fizzbuzz”);
  } else if (i % 3 === 0) {
   output.push(“fizz”);
  } else if (i % 5 === 0) {
   output.push(“buzz”);
  } else {
   output.push(i);
  }
 }

 return output;
}
```

#### 6. Stuck? Ask for Help!

if you got stuck at some point don’t be afraid to ask for some help or hints.

#### We’re All Human

Remember thst the interviewer has been in your position and understands the stress of interviews.
