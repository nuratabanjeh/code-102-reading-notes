## Python Regular Expression

Regular Expressions, regex, are a sequence of characters used to check whether a pattern exists in a given text (string) or not.

If you've ever used search engines, search and replace tools of word processors and text editors you've already seen regular expressions in use.

we can use them at the server side to validate the format of email addresses or passwords during registration, used for parsing text data files to find, replace, or delete certain string, etc. They help in manipulating textual data, which is often a prerequisite for data science projects involving text mining.

In Python, regular expressions are supported by the re module. That means that if you want to start using them in your Python scripts, you have to import this module with the help of import

### Basic Patterns: Ordinary Characters

The match() function returns a match object if the text matches the pattern. Otherwise, it returns None. The re module also contains several other functions, and you will learn some of them later on in the tutorial.

### Wild Card Characters: Special Characters

With the search function, you scan through the given string/sequence, looking for the first location where the regular expression produces a match.The group function returns the string matched by the re. You will see both these functions in more detail later.

If the character following the backslash is a recognized escape character, then the special meaning of the term is taken (Scenario 1)Else if the character following the \ is not a recognized escape character, then the \ is treated like any other character and passed through (Scenario 2).\ can be used in front of all the metacharacters to remove their special meaning (Scenario 3).

\w - Lowercase 'w'. Matches any single letter, digit, or underscore.

\W - Uppercase 'W'. Matches any character not part of \w (lowercase w).

\s - Lowercase 's'. Matches a single whitespace character like: space, newline, tab, return.

\S - Uppercase 'S'. Matches any character not part of \s (lowercase s).

\d - Lowercase 'd'. Matches decimal digit 0-9.

\D - Uppercase 'd'. Matches any character that is not a decimal digit.
