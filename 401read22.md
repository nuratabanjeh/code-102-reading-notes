# Working with forms

An HTML Form is a group of one or more fields/widgets on a web page, which can be used to collect information from users for submission to a server. Forms are a flexible mechanism for collecting user input because there are suitable widgets for entering many different types of data, including text boxes, checkboxes, radio buttons, date pickers and so on. Forms are also a relatively secure way of sharing data with the server, as they allow us to send data in POST requests with cross-site request forgery protection.

# HTML Forms

The form is defined in HTML as a collection of elements inside ```<form>...</form>``` tags, containing at least one input element of type="submit".
```
<form action="/team_name_url/" method="post">
    <label for="team_name">Enter name: </label>
    <input id="team_name" type="text" name="name_field" value="Default name for team.">
    <input type="submit" value="OK">
</form>
```
# Django form handling process

1. Display the default form the first time it is requested by the user.

2. Receive data from a submit request and bind it to the form.

3. Clean and validate the data.

4. If any data is invalid, re-display the form, this time with any user populated values and error messages for the problem fields.

5. If all data is valid, perform required actions (e.g. save the data, send an email, return the result of a search, upload a file, etc.)

6. Once all actions are complete, redirect the user to another page.

# Declaring a Form

The declaration syntax for a Form is very similar to that for declaring a Model, and shares the same field types (and some similar parameters). This makes sense because in both cases we need to ensure that each field handles the right types of data, is constrained to valid data, and has a description for display/documentation.

```
from django import forms

class RenewBookForm(forms.Form):
    renewal_date = forms.DateField(help_text="Enter a date between now and 4 weeks (default 3).")

```
