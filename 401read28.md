# Configuring Django Settings: Best Practices
## Managing Django Settings: Issues

* Different environments. Usually, you have several environments

* Sensitive data. You have SECRET_KEY in each Django project.

* Sharing settings between team members. You need a general approach to eliminate human error when working with the settings. 

* Django settings are a Python code. This is a curse and a blessing at the same time. It gives you a lot of flexibility, but can also be a problem – instead of key-value pairs, settings.py can have a very tricky logic.

## What is SSH

SSH, or Secure Shell, is a remote administration protocol that allows users to control and modify their remote servers over the Internet.

### How Does SSH Work

If you’re using Linux or Mac, then using SSH is very simple. If you use Windows, you will need to utilize an SSH client to open SSH connections.

### Understanding Different Encryption Techniques

The significant advantage offered by SSH over its predecessors is the use of encryption to ensure secure transfer of information between the host and the client.

### Hashing

One-way hashing is another form of cryptography used in Secure Shell Connections. One-way-hash functions differ from the above two forms of encryption in the sense that they are never meant to be decrypted.

### How Does SSH Work with These Encryption Techniques

The way SSH works is by making use of a client-server model to allow for authentication of two remote systems and encryption of the data that passes between them.
