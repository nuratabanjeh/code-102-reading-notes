# Dynamic Routes:

Defining routes by using predefined paths is not always enough for complex applications. In Next.js you can add brackets to a page` ([param]) `to create a dynamic route (a.k.a. url slugs, pretty urls, and others).

Consider the following page `pages/post/[pid].js`:
```
import { useRouter } from 'next/router'

const Post = () => {
  const router = useRouter()
  const { pid } = router.query

  return `<p>Post: {pid}</p>`
}

export default Post
```
