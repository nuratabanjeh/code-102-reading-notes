## proble domain:

A problem domain is the area of expertise or application that needs to be examined to solve a problem. A problem domain is simply looking at only the topics you are interested in, and excluding everything else.

It includes the goals that the problem owner wishes to achieve.



## Object Literal :

In plain English, an object literal is a comma-separated list of name-value pairs inside of curly braces.Those values can be properties and functions. Hereâ€™s a snippet of an object literal with one property and one function.

`var greeting = {

fullname: "Michael Jackson",

    greet: (message, name) => {

        console.log(message + " " + name + "!!");

    }
    
}`

Object literal should be used if you want to create objects on the go with no intention of copying values to another object or maybe mapping one object to another.

## JavaScript HTML DOM :

With the HTML DOM, JavaScript can access and change all the elements of an HTML document.

The HTML DOM (Document Object Model) :
When a web page is loaded, the browser creates a Document Object Model of the page. The HTML DOM model is constructed as a tree of Objects:

With the object model, JavaScript gets all the power it needs to create dynamic HTML:

- JavaScript can change all the HTML elements in the page

- JavaScript can change all the HTML attributes in the page

- JavaScript can change all the CSS styles in the page

- JavaScript can remove existing HTML elements and attributes

- JavaScript can add new HTML elements and attributes

- JavaScript can react to all existing HTML events in the page

- JavaScript can create new HTML events in the page

What is the DOM?

The DOM is a W3C (World Wide Web Consortium) standard.

The DOM defines a standard for accessing documents:

"The W3C Document Object Model (DOM) is a platform and language-neutral interface that allows programs and scripts to dynamically access and update the content, structure, and style of a document."

The W3C DOM standard is separated into 3 different parts:

Core DOM - standard model for all document types

XML DOM - standard model for XML documents

HTML DOM - standard model for HTML documents
