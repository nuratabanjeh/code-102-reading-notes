# Hashtables

Hashtables are a data structure that utilize key value pairs. This means every Node or Bucket has both a key, and a value.

## What is a Hashtable?

1. Hash

2. Backets

3. Collisions 

# Structure

## Hashing

a hash code turns a key into an integer.

### Creating a Hash

1. Add or multiply all the ASCII values together.

2. Multiply it by a prime number such as 599.

3. Use modulo to get the remainder of the result, when divided by the total size of the array.

4. Insert into the array at that index.

Example:
```
Key = "Cat"
Value = "Josie"

67 + 97 + 116 = 280

280 * 599 = 69648

69648 % 1024 = 16

Key gets placed in index of 16. 
```

### Collisions

A collision occurs when more than one key hashes to the same index in an array. 

### Hash maps do this to store values:

* accept a key

* calculate the hash of the key

* use modulus to convert the hash into an array index

* store the key with the value by appending both to the end of a linked list

### Hash maps do this to read value:

* accept a key

* calculate the hash of the key

* use modulus to convert the hash into an array index

* use the array index to access the short LinkedList representing a bucket

* search through the bucket looking for a node with a key/value 

* pair that matches the key you were given

### Bucket Sizes

Hash Maps can have any number of buckets. If a hash map has only a few buckets it will be densely full and have many collisions. 

## Internal Methods

* Add()

* Find()

* Contains()

* GetHash()
