# Custom User Model

for a real-world project, the official Django documentation highly recommends using a custom user model instead. This provides far more flexibility down the line so, as a general rule, always use a custom user model for all new Django projects.

There are two modern ways to create a custom user model in Django: AbstractUser and AbstractBaseUser. In both cases we can subclass them to extend existing functionality however AbstractBaseUser requires much, much more work. Seriously, don't mess with it unless you really know what you're doing.

# Setup

To start, create a new Django project from the command line. We need to do several things:

create and navigate into a dedicated directory called accounts for our code
install Django
make a new Django project called config
make a new app accounts
start the local web server
Here are the commands to run:

```
$ cd ~/Desktop
$ mkdir accounts && cd accounts
$ pipenv install django~=3.1.0
$ pipenv shell
(accounts) $ django-admin.py startproject config .
(accounts) $ python manage.py startapp accounts
(accounts) $ python manage.py runserver
```

Note that we did not run migrate to configure our database. It's important to wait until after we've created our new custom user model before doing so.

# AbstractUser vs AbstractBaseUser

There are two modern ways to create a custom user model in Django:
1. AbstractUser 
2. AbstractBaseUser

# Custom User Model

Creating our initial custom user model requires four steps:

* update config/settings.py

* create a new CustomUser model

* create new UserCreation and UserChangeForm

* update the admin

# Superuser

It's helpful to create a superuser that we can use to log in to the admin and test out log in/log out. On the command line type the following command and go through the prompts.
```
(accounts) $ python manage.py createsuperuser
```
