JupyterLab enables you to work with documents and activities such as Jupyter notebooks, text editors, terminals, and custom components in a flexible, integrated, and extensible manner. For a demonstration of JupyterLab and its features,.

### noteBook components:

1. the web application 
2. notebook documents
3. kernels

### python data analysis

#### NumPy

NumPy is a commonly used Python data analysis package. By using NumPy, you can speed up your workflow, and interface with other packages in the Python ecosystem.

#### Creating A NumPy Array

We can create a NumPy array using the numpy.array function. If we pass in a list of lists, it will automatically create a NumPy array with the same number of rows and columns. Because we want all of the elements in the array to be float elements for easy computation, weâ€™ll leave off the header row, which contains strings. One of the limitations of NumPy is that all the elements in an array have to be of the same type, so if we include the header row, all the elements in the array will be read in as strings. Because we want to be able to do computations like find the average quality of the wines, we need the elements to all be floats.
