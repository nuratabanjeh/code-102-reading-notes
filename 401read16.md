# Data Science Primer

### Machine learning : Machine learning (ML) is a type of artificial intelligence (AI) that allows software applications to become more accurate at predicting outcomes without being explicitly programmed to do so. Machine learning algorithms use historical data as input to predict new output values.

* Machine learning is the practice of teaching computers how to learn patterns from data, often for making decisions or predictions.For true machine learning, the computer must be able to learn patterns that it’s not explicitly programmed to identify.

* A task is a specific objective for your algorithms.

* Algorithms can be swapped in and out, as long as you pick the right task.

* In fact, you should always try multiple algorithms because you most likely won’t know which one will perform best for your dataset.

* The two most common categories of tasks are :

* Supervised Learning : includes tasks for “labeled” data (i.e. you have a target variable).

In practice, it’s often used as an advanced form of predictive modeling.

Each observation must be labeled with a “correct answer.”

Only then can you build a predictive model because you must tell the algorithm what’s “correct” while training it (hence, “supervising” it).

Regression is the task for modeling continuous target variables.

Classification is the task for modeling categorical (a.k.a. “class”) target variables.

* Unsupervised Learning : includes tasks for “unlabeled” data (i.e. you do not have a target variable).

In practice, it’s often used either as a form of automated data analysis or automated signal extraction.

Unlabeled data has no predetermined “correct answer.”

You’ll allow the algorithm to directly learn patterns from the data (without “supervision”).

Clustering is the most common unsupervised learning task, and it’s for finding groups within your data.

* Unsupervised Learning

* Unsupervised learning includes tasks for "unlabeled" data (i.e. you do not have a target variable).

* In practice, it's often used either as a form of automated data analysis or automated signal extraction.

* Unlabeled data has no predetermined "correct answer."

* Three elements of great machine learning

A skilled chef (Human guidance) - First, even though we are “teaching computers to learn on their own,” human guidance plays a huge role.

Fresh ingredients (Clean relative data) - The second essential element is the quality of your data.

Don’t overcook it (Avoid overfitting) - An overfit model has “memorized” the noise in the training set, instead of learning the true underlying patterns.

* The Blueprint

* Our machine learning blueprint is designed around those 3 elements.

* There are 5 core steps:

* Exploratory Analysis

First, "get to know" the data. This step should be quick, efficient, and decisive.

* Data Cleaning

Then, clean your data to avoid many common pitfalls. Better data beats 
 fancier algorithms.

* Feature Engineering

Next, help your algorithms "focus" on what's important by creating new features.

* Algorithm Selection
Choose the best, most appropriate algorithms without wasting your time.

* Model Training
Finally, train your models. This step is pretty formulaic once you've done the first 4.

* Data Cleaning

* Data cleaning is one of those things that everyone does but no one really talks about. Sure, it’s not the “best” part of machine learning. And no, there aren’t hidden tricks and secrets to uncover.

* However, proper data cleaning can make or break your project. Professional data scientists usually spend a very large portion of their time on this step.

* Better data beats fancier algorithms.

* In other words… garbage in gets you to garbage out. Even if you forget everything else from this course, please remember this point.

* In fact, if you have a properly cleaned dataset, even simple algorithms can learn impressive insights from the data!
