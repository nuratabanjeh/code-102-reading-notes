## what is python scope  and LEGB:

The concept of scope rules how variables and names are looked up in your code. It determines the visibility of a variable within the code.

The letters in the acronym LEGB stand for Local, Enclosing, Global, and Built-in scopes. This summarizes not only the Python scope levels but also the sequence of steps that Python follows when resolving names in a program.

## Python Scope vs Namespace

In Python, the concept of scope is closely related to the concept of the namespace. As you’ve learned so far, a Python scope determines where in your program a name is visible. Python scopes are implemented as dictionaries that map names to objects. These dictionaries are commonly called namespaces. These are the concrete mechanisms that Python uses to store names. They’re stored in a special attribute called ._dict_.

Python resolves names using the so-called LEGB rule, which is named after the Python scope for names. The letters in LEGB stand for Local, Enclosing, Global, and Built-in. Here’s a quick overview of what these terms mean:

* Local (or function) scope is the code block or body of any Python function or lambda expression. This Python scope contains the names that you define inside the function. These names will only be visible from the code of the function. It’s created at function call, not at function definition, so you’ll have as many different local scopes as function calls. This is true even if you call the same function multiple times, or recursively. Each call will result in a new local scope being created.

* Enclosing (or nonlocal) scope is a special scope that only exists for nested functions. If the local scope is an inner or nested function, then the enclosing scope is the scope of the outer or enclosing function. This scope contains the names that you define in the enclosing function. The names in the enclosing scope are visible from the code of the inner and enclosing functions.

* Global (or module) scope is the top-most scope in a Python program, script, or module. This Python scope contains all of the names that you define at the top level of a program or a module. Names in this Python scope are visible from everywhere in your code.

* Built-in scope is a special Python scope that’s created or loaded whenever you run a script or open an interactive session. This scope contains names such as keywords, functions, exceptions, and other attributes that are built into Python. Names in this Python scope are also available from everywhere in your code. It’s automatically loaded by Python when you run a program or script.

## The nonlocal Statement

Similarly to global names, nonlocal names can be accessed from inner functions, but not assigned or updated. If you want to modify them, then you need to use a nonlocal statement. With a nonlocal statement, you can define a list of names that are going to be treated as nonlocal.

The nonlocal statement consists of the nonlocal keyword followed by one or more names separated by commas. These names will refer to the same names in the enclosing Python scope. The following example shows how you can use nonlocal to modify a variable defined in the enclosing or nonlocal scope:

>>> def func():
...     var = 100  # A nonlocal variable
...     def nested():
...         nonlocal var  # Declare var as nonlocal
...         var += 100
...
...     nested()
...     print(var)
...
>>> func()
200

With the statement nonlocal var, you tell Python that you’ll be modifying var inside nested(). Then, you increment var using an augmented assignment operation. This change is reflected in the nonlocal name var, which now has a value of 200.

Unlike global, you can’t use nonlocal outside of a nested or enclosed function. To be more precise, you can’t use a nonlocal statement in either the global scope or in a local scope. Here’s an example:

>>> nonlocal my_var  # Try to use nonlocal in the global scope
  File "<stdin>", line 1
SyntaxError: nonlocal declaration not allowed at module level
>>> def func():
...     nonlocal var  # Try to use nonlocal in a local scope
...     print(var)
...
  File "<stdin>", line 2
SyntaxError: no binding for nonlocal 'var' found

In contrast to global, you can’t use nonlocal to create lazy nonlocal names. Names must already exist in the enclosing Python scope if you want to use them as nonlocal names. This means that you can’t create nonlocal names by declaring them in a nonlocal statement in a nested function. Take a look at the following code example:

>>> def func():
...     def nested():
...         nonlocal lazy_var  # Try to create a nonlocal lazy name
...
  File "<stdin>", line 3
SyntaxError: no binding for nonlocal 'lazy_var' found

In this example, when you try to define a nonlocal name using nonlocal lazy_var, Python immediately raises a SyntaxError because lazy_var doesn’t exist in the enclosing scope of nested().
